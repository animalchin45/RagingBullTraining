        review: `I can't speak highly enough of this place. The trainers are all incredibly knowledgeable and encouraging. Reggie, Kelso, and Janice have created a great space that has allowed me to grow so much in the 8 months I have been there. I never thought I would be the sort of person who goes to the gym every day, but now I can't get enough of it. This place is the best!`
